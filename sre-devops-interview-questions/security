Kubernetes Security

1. Can you explain what RBAC is in the context of Kubernetes security?
-> It control access of k8s resources on kubernetes. It stand for Role-Based-Access-Control. We can create role and
   role-binding/ Cluster role and Cluster role binding to provide access to cluster resources.

2. How can you make sure that containers are secure when running them on top of Kubernetes?
-> A. Make sure your using kubernetes latest version, as security patches are often released for new vulnerabilities.
   B. Aqua scan for find vulnerabilities and recommendation.

3. What is the best way to install certificates securely in a Kubernetes cluster?
-> Best way to install cert securely in a kubernetes cluster is to use kube-cert-manager tool.

Note: Kubernetes requires PKI certificates for authentication over TLS
4. Difference between TLS and SSL?
-> TLS, short for Transport Layer Security, and SSL, short for Secure Socket Layers, are both cryptographic protocols
   that encrypt data and authenticate a connection when moving data on the Internet.
   -> Well, TLS is actually just a more recent version of SSL. It fixes some security vulnerabilities in the earlier SSL
   protocols.

5. Certification concept ?
-> With a symmetrical key, a key is used to encrypt or sign the message, and the same key is used to decrypt the message.
-> With Public and Private keys, two keys are used that are mathematically related (they belong as a key pair),
   but are different.

   Digital certificates contain a copy of a public key from the certificate holder, which needs to be matched to a
   corresponding private key to verify it is real. A public key certificate is issued by certificate authorities (CAs),
   which sign certificates to verify the identity of the requesting device or user.
