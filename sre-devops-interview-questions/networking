1. Difference between TLS and SSL?
-> TLS, short for Transport Layer Security, and SSL, short for Secure Socket Layers, are both cryptographic protocols
   that encrypt data and authenticate a connection when moving data on the Internet.
   -> Well, TLS is actually just a more recent version of SSL. It fixes some security vulnerabilities in the earlier SSL
   protocols.
